Going to attempt to modularize this. I find it nearly impossible to keep up 
with the tens of thousands of lines of code in a single js file. Seeing as 
this code isn't being pushed over the web --it's an addon in one form or 
another-- it shouldn't hurt performance at all to split this up into more 
manageable files.
